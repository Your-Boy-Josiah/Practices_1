# Supermarket POS & Inventory System Backend

## 🗺️ Development Roadmap & Commit History

### Phase 1: Project Initialization & Setup
* **Initial Setup:** This is a Practices of My Backend Class from TS Academy. This was my first commit and I noticed I made some errors in my push (my node_modules and .env file were pushed). I will delete them on a later date, but for now, it's all okay.
* **User Architecture Started:** I created the User routes and Controller and had issues pushing to my GitHub so it looks like I did a second commit. Guess it would not be so easy, I have to fail to grow.
* **Documentation Added:** Added a README.md through a commit. That was fun to learn to do because I did not know what a README.md is, but I realize it's whatever I want it to be and a story of my code's journey. *(Note: I used AI today to write the below but I guess after today I wouldn't use it anymore, it requires a lot of supervision and people act like it doesn't, that is weird).*

### Phase 2: Core Data Models & Controllers
* **Schema Expansion:** I went back and rewrote both the `User` model and the `Product` model to be more complete and production-ready. Before, they were bare minimum. Now they are structured to actually support a real inventory management system for a store or supermarket — with proper fields, types, defaults, and validation in place.
* **Product Controller Rebuilt:** This was one of the biggest steps so far. I wrote the full `Product_Controller.js` which handles five core operations:
  - `CreateProduct`: Validates required fields, checks for duplicates, sanitizes input, and saves.
  - `GetProducts`: Returns paginated lists with support for search, category filtering, and low-stock filters.
  - `GetProductByBarcode`: Fast single-product lookup for POS scanner use.
  - `UpdateProduct`: Validates MongoDB ObjectId, normalizes fields, returns updated documents.
  - `DeleteProduct`: A soft delete (`isActive: false`) so historical sales data is never lost.
* **Product Routes Wired Up:** I wrote `Product_Routes.js` to wire up all the controller functions. Public routes are open, while creation/updates are protected behind `verifyToken` and `requireAdmin` middleware.

### Phase 3: Security, Architecture & Custom Features
* **Custom Architecture Rebuild:** Fully rewired the backend architecture. I created custom features and aliases (e.g., `const PM = require('mongoose')`) to personalize the code.
  - Added a `pre('save')` hook to `User.js` to hash passwords automatically.
  - Fixed Mongoose virtuals in `Product.js` using `toJSON: { virtuals: true }`.
  - Rewrote the User Controller to generate JWT tokens and handle duplicate key errors.
  - Built a clean `Database_Config.js` and wired everything in `app.js`.
* **Enterprise Backend Architecture Expanded:** Successfully architected and secured the core backend infrastructure. Key features implemented:
  - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Middleware managing permissions across User, Store_Keeper, Admin, and Super_Admin.
  - **ACID Database Transactions:** Engineered secure Sales and Restock controllers using MongoDB sessions.
  - **Automated Audit Trail:** Background logging tracking all mutations to an `AuditLog` collection.
  - **Analytics Engine:** Dashboard controller generating daily revenue and expiry alerts.
  - **Production-Grade Security:** Hardened with `helmet`, `express-rate-limit`, `cors`, and `express-mongo-sanitize`.
  - **Global Error Handling:** Unified error catcher to prevent server crashes.

### Phase 4: Bug Fixes, Codebase Cleanup & API Testing
* **Key Technical Issues Resolved:**
  - Fixed Path-to-RegExp / Express 404 Route Error.
  - Resolved `express-mongo-sanitize` Read-Only Property Crash.
  - Fixed Mongoose Modern Async Pre-Save Hook Crash (removed legacy `next` callbacks).
  - Integrated Multer Media Upload with disk storage, WebP conversion, and static serving.
* **Cleanup & File Security:** Cleaned up the codebase and re-enforced system security to ensure `.gitignore` is working perfectly. Added empty folders for future `Services` and `Utility` files. 
* **Backend Finalization & Transactions Tested:** Configured a local MongoDB Replica Set (`rs0`) to successfully run ACID transactions. Ran full API tests via `Test_Client.rest` and confirmed POS checkouts accurately deduct stock in real-time. Added `Test_Client.rest` to `.gitignore` to protect live JWT tokens.
* **Frontend Initialization:** Officially completed the backend testing phase and scaffolded the Phase 4 Frontend using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS!

##📌 Notes to Self

Always check .gitignore before the first push — node_modules and .env should never be committed.

The /barcode/:barcode route must always be declared before /:id in any Express router.

Use === undefined not !value when validating numeric fields — zero is a valid quantity.

Soft deletes (isActive: false) are safer than hard deletes for inventory systems — past sales records depend on the product data still being there.

You can create custom features/aliases like const PM = require('mongoose') to personalize the code.

Never put password hashing in the controller if you use a pre('save') hook in the model (avoids the double-hash bug).

Mongoose hides virtual fields by default. Always add toJSON: { virtuals: true } to the schema to see them in API responses.

Using .lean() in queries strips away Mongoose virtuals, so remove it if you need calculations to show up.

Login routes should always be POST, never PUT.

If the database fails to connect in the config, use process.exit(1) to kill the server.

MongoDB requires a Replica Set to be configured and initialized (rs.initiate()) before it allows ACID transactions and sessions.

Never commit .rest testing files to GitHub if they contain live JWT authentication tokens. Always add them to .gitignore.
